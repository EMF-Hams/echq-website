Hello, I am a page about [MastCar](https://mastcar.uk). I am an ex-BBC outside broadcast vehicle, and am living out my days as a Tactical Response Vehicle for the MastCar A.R.C.

I will be at EMFCamp 2024, and using my large erection to hold many things.

MastCar A.R.C. will be operating under the callsign [G1CAR](https://www.qrz.com/db/G1CAR), across various bands. I can also be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mast_car) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.radio/@mast_car).
