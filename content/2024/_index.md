## Who?
There's a list of [people attending]({{< ref "people" >}}) here. You might know some of them, but if you don't most of them are friendly and you will by the end of EMFCamp! Please feel free to add yourself to this page.

## What?
There's various [services]({{< ref "services" >}}) and [things]({{< ref "things" >}}) present that might interest you, if you choose to visit our little village.

## Where?
We'll hopefully be up in the North East corner somewhere.

## Why?
If you donâ€™t know, get to know!

## How do I get in touch?
We're mostly active on [Telegram](https://t.me/+b2gKTnNcADJkNDk0). If you don't use Telegram you can probably get hold of us on the EMF IRC / Matrix channels.
